During my fourteen years of experience as an accountant, I have been working as a chief accountant for the past nine years and am responsible for the entire accounting cycle at two manufacturing companies.
The ability to work quickly, the ability to plan time and plan actions effectively allowed me to accept an offer and be responsible for a few more real estate companies a few years ago.
A strong sense of responsibility allowed me to ensure that day-to-day operations and year-end reports were completed on time.
